Addition(+):
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
 <!-- output is 7 -->
let x = 7;
let y = 8;
let z = x + y;
<!-- output is 15 -->

Subtraction(-):
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;
<!-- ouput is 3 -->
let x = 7;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;
<!-- output is 5 -->

Multiplication(*):
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
<!-- output is 10 -->
let x = 10;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
<!-- output is 20 -->

Modulus(%):
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x % y;
<!-- ouput is 1 -->

<!-- output is 0 -->

Division(/):
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y
<!-- ouput is 2 -->
let x = 6;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y
<!-- output is 3 -->

Increment(++):

<!-- z is 6. It's incremented by 1 -->
let x = 7;
x++;
let z = x;
<!-- z is 8. It's incremented by 1 -->

Decrement(--):
let x = 5;
x--;

<!-- z is 4. It's decremented by 1 -->
let x = 7;
x--;

<!-- z is 6. It's decremented by 1 -->

The assignment operator:
x = y	
x += y

The comparison operators: Given that x = 5
Equal to(==):
x == 8

<!-- false -->
Not equal(!=):
x != 8
<!-- true -->
x != 3
<!-- true -->
Less than(<):
x < 8 
<!-- true -->

<!-- true -->
Greater than(>):
x > 2
<!-- true -->
x > 8
<!-- false -->
Greater than or equal to(>=):
x >= 8
<!-- false -->
